 Task:
 Use Python to connect to a MySQL database and run queries

 Stack:
     - Python + pymysql/mysql-connector-python
     - VDS + LAMP-server

 Flow:
       1. VDS
       2. LAMP-server installation
       3. Create access via phpMyadmin.

       4. open:
         $ cd /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d
         $ nano mysqld.cnf
       5. Edit like this:
              #bind-address = 127.0.0.1 /comment
              mysqlx-bind-address = 127.0.0.1 /leave it as it was
              bind-address = 0.0.0.0 /add
       6. On the server we create a user with access from any ip:
             CREATE USER 'user_name'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password123';
       7. Give him all the "privileges":
             GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'user_name'@'%';
       8. Reload privileges:
             FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
       9. Repeat the same for him with access on "localhost" / it remains to be seen why and whether this is necessary)
             CREATE USER 'user_name'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password123';
             GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'user_name'@'localhost';
             FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
       10. Creating a project in PyCharm:
             * We can use Python MySQL , using various modules or technologies already provided.
               Some of them are:
                   MySQL Connector Python
                   PyMySQL
                   MySQLdb
                   mysqlclient
                   OurSQL
               All of the above technologies use the same syntax and methods to connect
               and perform operations on the MySQL database, following PEP 249 .
             * Install PyMySQL (pip install pymysql) and for comparison
             * Install MySQL Connector/Python (pip install mysql-connector-python)
             * Install the library criptography (pip install criptography) / without it SSH-connection does not work
       11. test the connection.
       12. Consider PyMySQL methods simultaneously with:
             * viewing the DB on the remote server;
             * creating a DB;
             * creating tables;
             * perform CRUD-actions.
       13. Importing the database through PhpMyAdmin
       14. Importing the database through WinSCP:
             * download the database dump (*.sql extension) or create it with the help of third-party software
             * transfer it to the host (for example, using WinSCP)
             * then on the host:
                ~# mysql -user_name -p db_name < our_db_file.sql
